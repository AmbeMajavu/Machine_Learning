This repository demonstrates a simple example of hierarchical clustering using Python. It uses a small dataset and visualizes the results with a dendrogram.

### What is Hierarchical Clustering? 
Hierarchical clustering is an unsupervised learning method for clustering data points. 
The algorithm builds clusters by measuring the dissimilarities between data. 
Unsupervised learning means that a model does not have to be trained, and we do not need a "target" variable. 
This method can be used on any data to visualize and interpret the relationship between individual data points.

### Dendrogram
A dendrogram is a diagram that shows the arrangement of the clusters produced by hierarchical clustering.

### Code Overview

The main Python script, `hierarchical_clustering.py`, includes the following steps:
1. Importing necessary libraries
2. Creating a dataset
3. Performing hierarchical clustering
4. Visualizing the dendrogram

## Setup and Running the Example
Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.
